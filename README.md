# Financial Forecasting

## Abstract

Stock market or equity market have a profound impact in today’s economy. A rise or fall in the share price has an important role in determining the investor’s gain.
The existing forecasting methods make use of both linear (AR,MA,ARIMA) and non-linear algorithms (ARCH,GARCH,Neural Networks),
but they focus on predicting the stock index movement or price forecasting for a single company using the daily closing price. 

The proposed method is a model independent approach. Here we are not fitting the data to a specific model, rather we are identifying the latent dynamics existing 
in the data using deep learning architectures. In this work we use three different deep learning architectures for the price prediction of NSE listed companies
and compare their performance. We are applying a sliding window approach for predicting future values on a short term basis.The performance of the models were
quantified using percentage error. Index Terms—Time series, Stock market, RNN,LSTM,CNN


## Implementation

We use a Motion Detection Algorithm that uses a **background subtraction** method with **recursive updates** of thresholds and estimated backgrounds.
